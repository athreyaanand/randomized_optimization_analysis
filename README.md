# Randomized Optimizations in Machine Learning: An Analysis

This deep dive focused on three randomized optimization algorithms (Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, and Random Hill Climbing) and their implementations within a neural network as well as two unique search problems; the project was primarily completed with python 2.7 and ABAGAIL: an open source machine learning library written in JAVA.

To run these scripts yourself, make sure you have the following python dependencies installed: matplotlib, scipy, sklearn, numpy. If running java, make sure you have a jdk installed on the machine. Once installed simply call 'python <filename>' or 'java <filename>' in the specific directory and watch the magic happen!
